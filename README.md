# KNOT-THEORY
### README: Introduction to Knot Theory

## Overview

Knot theory is a branch of topology that studies mathematical knots. Unlike the common notion of knots in everyday life, mathematical knots are closed loops in 3-dimensional space that do not intersect themselves. Knot theory investigates the properties of these knots and how they can be transformed or manipulated within certain constraints.
